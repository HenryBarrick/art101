			<h1>Lab 13 - Loops</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to use loops in order to create a 
						a javaScript program that would iterate a semi-complex task from 0 
						to 200.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Since we did this lab in class, fairly recently, there also weren't too many problms we had to deal with
						for this lab. One issue we did have was trying to properly link the button we made with the function, but
						 a workaround for this was just setting the loop as an anonymous function.
					</p>
