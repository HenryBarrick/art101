					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to use java script to add elements with a specific class to a specific section in
						our html file.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We had few problems with this section, mostly caused by a few errant keystrokes. One issue was caused by forgetting
						to add a "#" symbol in front of our button identifier and it wasn't linked together as a result. Other than that
						most of what we troubleshooted was getting the css to look nice.
					</p>
