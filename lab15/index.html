			<h1>Lab 15 - AJAX</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to use an AJAX call to get an output from our API,
						of which we used the Jeopardy one. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We had a few probems connecting the API to our JavaScript file. The first was just unfamiliarity using AJAX
						since it is something neither of us had done before. However using the "recipe" from Canvas we got the 
						hang of it. Secondly we had some decent issues trying to pull data from the API. This error turned out to be due
						to the fact that Jeopardy API send its objects in arrays, and since we were only using one pull this meant
						we recieved an object nestled in a 1 length array. Once we figured this out, we changed our code and were
						able to call our data from the API and complete the lab.</p>
